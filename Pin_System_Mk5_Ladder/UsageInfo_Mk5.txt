PROJECT: PIN Code System
VERSION: Mk5
AUTHOR: Aleksander Pilawka
PLATFORM: WindLDR (Ladder)
DATE: 20.07.2025
==============================

DESCRIPTION:
-------------
This is a 4-digit PIN code verification system built in WindLDR Ladder format.
It simulates a secure access system with input validation, state memory, and error handling.

FEATURES:
---------
- 4-digit PIN entry (one digit at a time)
- Visual feedback (LEDs/Outputs toggle after full PIN)
- PIN comparison using data registers
- Three states: Setting mode, Access mode, and Requirement mode
- Input debouncing and digit validation
- 30 second penalty after 3 incorrect tries
- Marker and Data Register optimization for memory

HOW TO USE:
-----------
- 4-digit PIN entry with visual feedback
- Three main modes:
   • Setting Mode (initial state)
   • Accessing Mode (after PIN set)
   • Requirement Mode (PIN change authentication)
- 3 wrong attempts trigger 30-second lockout
- Manual PIN reset: press Enter + Clear simultaneously
- Input clear button at any stage
- Flickering LEDs as feedback on successful or incorrect PIN entry

MODE FLOW:
----------
1. First Startup → Enters Setting Mode:
   - User inputs new 4-digit PIN
   - Press "Enter" to confirm

2. Accessing Mode:
   - User inputs 4-digit PIN to unlock
   - Green lamp flickers if correct
   - Red if incorrect
   - 3 wrong attempts = 30s lockout (M17 Active)

3. Change PIN Flow:
   - Press Enter + Clear simultaneously
   - Program enters Requirement Mode
   - Input previous PIN to verify identity
   - If correct: returns to Setting Mode

BUTTONS:
--------
- Digit Inputs: I0-I7,I10,I12 - Digits 0-9
- Enter: I13
- Clear: I11
- Mode Reset (Enter + Clear): triggers Requirement Mode

OUTPUTS:
--------
- Green Lamp: Q1 (Access granted flicker)
- Red Lamp: Q0 (Error)

MEMORY USAGE:
-------------
- Markers:
   • M14-M16 - Mode Markers
   • M17 - 30 Second Penalty Active
   • M100 - All Inputs Off Flag
   • M101 - Triggers Green LED flickering when access granted
   • M102 - Triggers Red LED flickering when access denied
   • M103 - An output from 4 comparators saying if the input pin is correct or not
   • M104 - temp marker, will get rid of it in next version

- Data Registers:
   • D0 - Active Step
   • D1 - Data Register that helps setting temporary pin
   • D2 - Incorrect Attempts Counter
   • D10-D13 - Temp Data Registers, used for comparison
   • D100-D103 - The Actual Pin Registers

- Timers:
   • T0-T2 - Responsible for Flickering Green Led
   • T3-T5 - Responsible for Flickering Red Led
   • T7 - Penalty Timer, 30 seconds

NOTES:
------
- All logic has been manually tested and debugged.
- Logic structure is ready for future porting to other platforms.
- Fixed issues in version Mk5:
   - Cleaned unused markers
   
HOW TO RUN:
-----------
1. Load the `.pjw` file in WindLDR
2. Use the simulator or hardware inputs mentioned earlier
3. Follow on-screen LED/Output feedback
4. In ProjectWindow/CustomMonitors there is a Monitor ready where you can look at active markers and currect data stored in Data Registers
