# PIN System (Prototype) — WindLDR

This was the first attempt at building a 4-digit PIN code system in WindLDR using ladder logic and scripting.

## Status
- Incomplete / Partially Functional  
- Prototype — Used to explore input handling and mode separation.

## Features Attempted
- 4-digit PIN input system
- Modes: PIN Setting / Set Requirement / Accessing
- Step-by-step logic using markers
- Visual outputs triggered by steps

## Key Learnings
- Redundant logic (each mode handled separately)
- High memory usage script alone has ~15KB
- Missing reset/fail-safe conditions in some steps

## Notes
- This version laid the groundwork for Mk2 and Mk3, where logic was unified and memory usage drastically reduced.
