# PIN System Mk2 â€” WindLDR
This was my second attempt at building Pin System, and this one is actually working!

## Status
  - Functional
    
## Features
  - 4-digit PIN input system
  - Modes: PIN Setting / Set Requirement / Accessing
  - Step-by-step logic using markers.
  - 30 Second Penalty System after 3 wrong inputs
  - Red and Green leds flicker 3 times based on corresponding outcome

## Key Learnings
  - More Compact and Readable logic
  - Over 2x reduction in memory usage compared to the prototype
    
## Notes
  - This version helped me understand structuring complex logic more clearly and efficiently.
